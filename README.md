## My process

### Tech Stack

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nextjs,react,tailwind,nodejs)](https://skillicons.dev)

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

- [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts)
- [Learn Responsive Design](https://web.dev/learn/design)
- about the CSS `clamp()` function
- about media query of tailwindcss
  ```js
      <div className="mx-auto flex w-full max-w-[316px] flex-col gap-8 md:max-lg:max-w-[1114px] lg:max-w-max lg:flex-row lg:items-center">
      {/* Card1 */}
  ```

### Continued development

- Iâ€™d like to deepen my understanding of what I learned in Conquering Responsive Layouts and Learn Responsive Design.
- I want to gain a deeper understanding of why mobile-first design is considered a best practice.
